Explain the code execution based on the order of the messages logged in src/quiz/promise-2darray.txt.

The promise immediately logs 'Sum called ...' when the function is called, but the actual summation happens 
asynchronously inside setTimeout().

When function is called with empty array, the promise is rejected right away, and 'Cannot sum an empty array' 
is passed to the catch block, ensuring it does not proceed to the setTimeout.

For non-empty arrays, the promise performs the summation asynchronously, and after the setTimeout(), the sum 
is resolved and logged.

The log 'Returning from sum' appears before the summation or rejection happens because the setTimeout() defers 
the actual work to the event loop.


The order of logs:

"Sum called ..." and "returning from sum" are logged immediately.

If empty array is passed, the error is logged after "Rejecting empty array."

For non-empty arrays, the summation logs occur after a brief asynchronous delay.

This makes code produce the expected result or error message.
